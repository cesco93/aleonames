# aleo_names.aleo Contract

## Overview

This Aleo program is designed to manage a collection of NFTs that represent domain names and their subdomains within a decentralized name service. It includes functionality for registering, transferring, and managing these digital assets with privacy features provided by the Aleo platform.

## Features

- **Name Validation**: Ensures that all registered names comply with valid ASCII character rules for domain names.
- **Ownership Management**: Transfers ownership of NFTs privately or publicly, and manages primary name assignments for addresses.
- **Minting Control**: Allows the collection owner to set block heights for minting and update minting settings.
- **URI Management**: Handles base URI updates for the NFT metadata.
- **Resolver Management**: Sets and unsets resolvers for domain names, allowing for flexible management of domain-associated resources.
- **NFT Burning**: Provides a method to burn (permanently remove) NFTs from the collection.

## Contract Initialization

To initialize the contract, the `initialize_collection` transition must be called with the total number of NFTs, a symbol, and a base URI. This transition can only be executed once.

## Minting

Minting is controlled via the `set_mint_block` transition which sets the block height at which minting becomes possible. The `update_toggle_settings` can be used to enable or disable minting and other features.

## Name Registration

New names can be registered using the `register` transition, which creates a new NFT after validating the name and ensuring payment. Subdomains can be registered using the `register_sub` or `register_sub_public` transitions.

## Transfers

NFTs can be transferred using the `transfer_private` or `transfer_public` transitions, allowing for both private and public changes in ownership.

## Ownership Proof

The `authorize` transition serves as a way to provide proof of NFT ownership without revealing the NFT itself, though it is designed to always fail.

## NFT Burning

NFTs can be removed from circulation using the `burn` transition.

## Resolver Management

The `set_resolver` and `unset_resolver` transitions are used to manage domain resolvers, which link domain names to resources.

## Contract Deployment

Instructions for deploying the contract to the Aleo network should be detailed here.
